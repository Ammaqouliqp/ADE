# Maintainer Notes

This project is maintained with a strict focus on correctness and safety.

Features that reduce user friction at the cost of data safety will not be accepted.

When unsure:
- Prefer disabling an action
- Provide explanation to the user
- Document the limitation

This is not a beginner toy — it is a professional tool.
